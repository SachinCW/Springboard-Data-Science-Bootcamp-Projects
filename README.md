# Springboard Data Science Bootcamp Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on as part of a 6 month intensive Data Science Bootcamp by Springboard.

The files in the repository and their brief decription is mentioned below - 

**api_data_wrangling_mini_project.ipynb :**

This project required pulling some data from the Qunadl API; Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data. Equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE) was the focus data. Analysis of the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec was performed in this project.
While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Quandl API, I used the requests package for this project and instead of using Pandas which is a very handy package, I made use of Python's native data structures such as Lists and Dictionaries.
