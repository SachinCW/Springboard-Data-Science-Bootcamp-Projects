# Springboard Data Science Bootcamp Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on as part of a 6 month intensive Data Science Bootcamp by Springboard.


The files in the repository and their brief decription is mentioned below - 

**api_data_wrangling_mini_project.ipynb :**

This project required pulling some data from the Qunadl API; Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data. Equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE) was the focus data. Analysis of the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec was performed in this project.
While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Quandl API, I used the requests package for this project and instead of using Pandas which is a very handy package, I made use of Python's native data structures such as Lists and Dictionaries.

**Mini_Project_Data_Wrangling_Pandas.ipynb :**

In this project, I discovered some interesting data based on movie data from the IMDB.
This assignment helped reinforce the concepts of Data Wrangling and sharpen the skills in using Pandas. 

**Mini_Project_Wrangling_Json_Exercise.ipynb :**

This project dealt with data wrangling using JSON files as source and helped get familiar with packages for dealing with JSON.

**Mini_Project_SQL_with_Spark.ipynb :**

This project dealt with getting familiar with Spark SQL.
Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. It provides a programming abstraction called DataFrames and can also act as a distributed SQL query engine. It enables unmodified Hadoop Hive queries to run up to 100x faster on existing deployments and data. It also provides powerful integration with the rest of the Spark ecosystem (e.g., integrating SQL query processing with machine learning).
It brings native support for SQL to Spark and streamlines the process of querying data stored both in RDDs (Sparkâ€™s distributed datasets) and in external sources. Spark SQL conveniently blurs the lines between RDDs and relational tables. Unifying these powerful abstractions makes it easy for developers to intermix SQL commands querying external data with complex analytics, all within in a single application.
